- What's FIDO2?

FIDO2 is a secure authentication standard that replaces passwords with cryptographic keys. It uses a hardware device (like a USB or NFC key) to prove your identity by signing a challenge from the website. This keeps your credentials safe and makes phishing attacks nearly impossible.
